The project's goal was to use machine learning techniques to increase the accuracy of phishing detection. 
The study made use of the Dataset of Malicious and Benign Webpages, which contained information about top-level domains (TLDs), content, IP addresses, geolocation, URL length, content, HTTPS status, WHOIS data, and JavaScript length and obfuscation length.
To categorise webpages as dangerous or benign, the research utilised three algorithms: AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
The efficacy of the SVM and AdaBoost models in identifying phishing attempts was demonstrated by their respective 98% accuracy rates.
With an astounding accuracy of 99.94%, the RNN beat the other two, demonstrating its better capacity to identify intricate patterns in the data.
The experiment offered a thorough comparison of different algorithms, which gave important information for creating phishing detection systems with greater resilience.
